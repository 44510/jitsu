# NextJS Guide

## Installation

With NextJS there're several ways on how to add Jitsu tracking

## Client Side Tracking

Since Next JS is based on React, [React Guide](/docs/sending-data/js-sdk/react) will work as well. However, there's a caveat:
 * `usePageView` relies on react-router, which is not part of Next.js (Question: can we support next.js router too)
 * `useJitsu` requires subsequent `useEffect()` which disable static and SSO pre-rendering (is it true????)

```jsx
import { useJitsu } from "@jitsu/react";

const App = () => {
  useJitsu();

  useEffect(() => {
    id({id: '__USER_ID__', email: '__USER_EMAIL__'})
    trackPageView()
  }, [])

  return (
    //Won't be rendered staticly or in Server
    <Component />
  )
}
```

The latter can be addressed by wrapping Jitsu into separate component (is it true???).

```jsx
import { useJitsu } from "@jitsu/react";

const Jitsu = () => {
  useJitsu();

  useEffect(() => {
    id({id: '__USER_ID__', email: '__USER_EMAIL__'})
    trackPageView()
  }, [])

}

const App = () => {
  return <>
    <Jitsu />
    <Component />
  </>
}
```

## Server Side Tracking

Jitsu can track events server-side"
 * *Pros:* this method is 100% reliable and ad-block resistant, and
 * *Cons:* static rendering will not be possible; `next export` will not work; fewer data points will be collected - attributes such as screen-size, device

### Manual tracking

TODO: insert manual tracking instructions

### Automated page view tracking

Jitsu could track page views automatically via use of `_middleware.js` which has been introduced in NextJS 12
