# SSO Authentication

Jitsu supports following SSO providers:
* [BoxyHQ](https://boxyhq.com/)

### Configuration

By default, SSO authentication is disabled. For enabling it put the following keys in **Jitsu Configurator** YAML configuration:

* `provider` — SSO provider. For now only `boxyhq` is supported
* `host` — SSO provider host
* `tenant` — read more about this parameter and boxyhq auth flow [here](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/saml-flow#3-oauth-20-flow)
* `product` — read more about this parameter and boxyhq auth flow [here](https://boxyhq.com/docs/jackson/saml-flow#3-oauth-20-flow)
* `access_token_ttl_seconds` — time to live for SSO auth session.

```yaml
sso:
  provider: 'boxyhq'
  host: '___boxyhq_host___'
  tenant: '___your_tenant___'
  product: '___your_product___'
  access_token_ttl_seconds: 86400,
```

or you can configure it with env variable `JITSU_SSO_CONFIG`:

```bash
export JITSU_SSO_CONFIG='{"provider": "boxyhq", "host": "https://boxyhq.com", "tenant": "boxyhq.com", "product": "jitsu", "access_token_ttl_seconds": 86400}'
```

After you have configured the SSO auth, the "Continue with SSO" button will appear on the authorization page.
